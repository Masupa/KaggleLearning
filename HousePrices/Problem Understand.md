## :‚öôÔ∏è Business Understanding

Initially, it is vital to understand the problem to be solved. Therefore, this is the first step I take in solving any sort of problem. 
Some questions I ask are: what is the problem? What exactly do we want to do? Why are we facing this problem? Given an understanding of 
the business, I further seek to prompt the problem with questions arising from a deeper understanding of the business.

In understanding the problem, the idea is to get to the root cause of the problem, and later on try to understand whether the problem 
that can be solved using data: will a data science solution aid in solving the problem?

Once I‚Äôve determined that the business problem can be viewed from a data perspective, the next thing is to think carefully about the 
data that might be useful and how it would be used. Do we have the data? If so, where is it sitting? If not, can we find the time 
somewhere? If not, can we invest in processes that will enable us to collect the data needed to solve this problem?
